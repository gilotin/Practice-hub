# Practice Hub - Improvement Checklist

## HIGH PRIORITY (Fix First)

### Content & Structure

-   Add project showcase/cards to homepage (currently too empty)
-   Include brief descriptions for each project
-   Add tech stack tags to project cards
-   Link each project card to its respective page

### Navigation

-   Make active navigation state more prominent/obvious
-   Consider adding underline or background highlight for active link

### Branding

-   Add custom favicon (replace default Vite/React logo)
-   Could use initials "NT" or simple icon

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish)

### Typography

-   Establish clear hierarchy (h1, h2, p sizes and weights)
-   Increase heading font weights for better contrast
-   Adjust line heights for improved readability
-   Consider larger font sizes for better visual impact

### Links & Interactions

-   Add hover states to all links
-   Consider external link indicators (arrow icon, etc.)
-   Add smooth transitions to interactive elements
-   Improve GitHub link visibility and styling

### Layout

-   Add footer with copyright/build info
-   Consider max-width constraint for main content
-   Ensure consistent spacing throughout

---

## LOW PRIORITY (Nice-to-Have)

### Visual Enhancements

-   Add project thumbnails/screenshots
-   Include demo GIFs or videos for projects
-   Add subtle animations (hover effects, transitions)

### Features

-   Dark mode toggle (optional but impressive)
-   Loading states for async operations
-   Breadcrumb navigation for deeper pages

### Content Depth

-   Add "What I Learned" sections to project pages
-   Include challenges faced and solutions
-   Link to GitHub repo for each individual project
-   Consider adding blog section for technical write-ups

---

## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

### Color & Style

-   Choose one accent color for links/CTAs
-   Ensure sufficient color contrast for accessibility
-   Consider adding subtle background variations

### Responsive Design

-   Test and optimize for mobile devices
-   Ensure project grid adapts well to different screens
-   Check navigation on smaller viewports

---

## RECRUITER PERSPECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS

### First Impression (10 seconds)

-   Make it immediately clear what skills you have
-   Show variety of projects upfront
-   Demonstrate you can ship complete features

### Deeper Exploration (30+ seconds)

-   Provide context for each project (why you built it)
-   Make it easy to view source code
-   Show technical depth in descriptions
-   Demonstrate learning progression

## NOTES

**Current Rating:** 6/10 - Solid foundation, needs content  
**Potential Rating:** 8-9/10 - After implementing high priority items

**Key Strength:** Clean, professional, fast, functional  
**Main Weakness:** Homepage lacks content and project showcase

**Quick Win:** Adding project cards to homepage (~30 min effort, massive impact)

## REFACTORING OPPORTUNITIES (For Later Practice)

-   Extract ProjectCard into reusable component
-   Create shared Layout component for consistent page structure
-   Implement custom hooks for common logic
-   Add TypeScript interfaces for project data
-   Consider state management if project list grows
-   Set up route-based code splitting
